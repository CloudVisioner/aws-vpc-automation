# aws-vpc-automation
This repository contains a Python script that automates the creation of an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) along with essential networking components using Boto3. It checks for an existing VPC and, if not found, creates a new one along with an Internet Gateway (IGW), Route Table, and three subnets across different availability zones.
